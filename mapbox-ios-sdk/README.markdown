MapBox iOS SDK
--------------

Based on the Route-Me iOS map library (Alpstein fork) with [MapBox][mapbox] customizations. 

Requires iOS 5, Xcode 5.0 or greater, and ARC.

Major differences from [Alpstein fork of Route-Me](https://github.com/Alpstein/route-me): 

 * Requires iOS 5.0 and above. 
 * Supports Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). 
 * [MapBox](http://mapbox.com) & [MBTiles](http://mbtiles.org) tile source integration code. 
 * [MapBox Markers](http://mapbox.com/blog/markers/) support. 
 * [UTFGrid interactivity](http://mapbox.com/mbtiles-spec/utfgrid/). 
 * Improved network tile loading performance. 
 * A bulk, background map tile downloader for cache pre-population. 
 * Annotation callouts that behave like MapKit. 
 * Annotation convenience subclasses for points and shapes. 
 * Prepackaged [binary framework](http://mapbox.com/blog/ios-sdk-framework/). 
 * [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) support. 
 * Removal of two-finger double-tap gesture for zoom out (to speed up two-finger single-tap recognition like MapKit). 
 * Different default starting location for maps. 
 * Built-in attribution view controller with button on map views & default OpenStreetMap attribution. 
 * Easy static map view support. 
 * Removal of included example projects in favor of separate examples on GitHub. 
 * A few added defaults for convenience. 
 * Improved documentation.

Route-Me
--------

Route-Me is an open source map library that runs natively on iOS.  It's designed to look and feel much like the built-in iOS map library, but it's entirely open, and works with any map source using a pluggable backend system. 

Supported map tile sources include [MapBox][1]/[TileStream][2], the offline-capable, database-backed format [MBTiles][3], [OpenStreetMap][4], and several others. 

Please note that you are responsible for getting permission to use the map data, and for ensuring your use adheres to the relevant terms of use.

Installation
------------

There are three ways that you can install the SDK, depending upon your needs: 

 1. Clone from GitHub and integrate as a dependent Xcode project. 
 1. Use the [binary framework](http://mapbox-ios-sdk.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). Use like regular frameworks, linking it in your project, adding `#import <MapBox/MapBox.h>`, and additionally, including the `-ObjC` linker flag. 
 1. Install via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). 

More detailed information on the installation options is available in the [SDK guide](http://mapbox.com/mapbox-ios-sdk/). 

The two main branches of the GitHub repository are pretty self-explanatory: `release` and `develop`. When we tag a [release](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/tags), we also merge `develop` over to `release`, except in the case of minor point releases (e.g., `0.4.2`), where we might just bring over a fix or two from `develop`. 

Then, update the submodules:

      git submodule update --init

Some example apps showing usage of the SDK (with screenshots):

 * [MapBox iOS Example](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-example) - online, offline, and interactive tile sources
 * [MapBox Me](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-me) - user location services and terrain toggling
 * [Weekend Picks](https://github.com/mapbox/weekend-picks-template-ios) - markers and data

More documentation is available: 

      http://mapbox.com/mapbox-ios-sdk/

There are two subdirectories - MapView and Proj4. Proj4 is a support library used to do map projections. The MapView project contains only the Route-Me map library. 

See License.txt for license details. In any app that uses this SDK, include the following text on your "preferences" or "about" screen: "Uses MapBox iOS SDK, (c) 2008-2013 MapBox and Route-Me Contributors". Your data provider will have additional attribution requirements.
